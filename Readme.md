# My Prompt

This repo contains a file with a prompt example for `bash`. Modified from the prompt of **[rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob)**.

My version is simpler, and I changed the style and colors to my liking.

## How to use

Copy the content of `prompt.sh` to your `.bashrc` and execute:

```bash
exec bash -l
```
